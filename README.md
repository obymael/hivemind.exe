## BloomWatch: An Earth Observation Application for Global Flowering Phenology

Witness the pulse of life across our planet! From season to season and year to year, Earth’s vegetation is constantly changing, providing critical information on plant species, crops, seasonal effects, pollen sources, and changes in plant phenology (the relationship between seasonal changes and climate and biological phenomena in plants). Your challenge is to harness the power of NASA Earth observations to create a dynamic visual tool that displays and/or detects plant blooming events around the globe—just like pollinators do–and that advances solutions for monitoring, predicting, or managing vegetation.

## Challenge Considerations
The temporal capability of NASA’s Earth observing satellites and the spatial resolution of the datasets used may impact the type of blooms that can be detected.
Your tool could:
    Be interactive, and zoom into specific locations.
    Show trends across time.
    Explain ecological and conservation implications.
    What decisions could your tool inform?
