            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
            We are <strong>Flower Power Tower Girls</strong> ‚Äì a small but mighty team of three software engineers who came together for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025. Our project, <em>hivemind.exe</em>, was born from a shared love of bees and the rhythms of plants. Bees follow the pulse of flowers across ecosystems; with NASA Earth observations, we aim to help everyone witness that same pulse on Earth.
            </p>

            <p>
            That idea became the <strong>Bloom Wave Visualizer</strong>, our submission to the challenge
            ‚ÄúBloomWatch: An Earth Observation Application for Global Flowering Phenology.‚Äù It transforms NASA‚Äôs data into a living story:
            </p>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Animated 3D globe</strong> where blooming events appear as colorful waves pulsing across continents.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal transitions</strong> that show spring ‚Äúflowing‚Äù northward in the Northern Hemisphere (and southward in the Southern).</li>
            <li><strong>Regional signatures</strong> like the dramatic greening of the Sahel during the monsoon season.</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term change</strong> revealing how climate shifts alter bloom timing around the world.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Our vision is more than visualization. We‚Äôre building a tool that scientists, farmers, policymakers, and curious minds can use to monitor, predict, and manage vegetation patterns‚Äîhelping us all stay in tune with the planet‚Äôs rhythms.
            </p>

            <p>
            At heart, our project is about curiosity, collaboration, and creativity ‚Äì and a little bit of flower power. üå∏üêù
